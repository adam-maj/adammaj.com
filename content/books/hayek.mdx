A concise overview of all of Hayek's important contributions to economics, political philosophy, and the study of social sciences. Very true to Hayek, quotes him in all the right places, and has a deep understanding of what he is trying to say. Excellent read owing largely to the insight density of Hayek's thinking.

Feels like Hayek's equivalent of _The Essays of Warren Buffet_, in that it may be a better entrypoint into his extensive work then any of his own writings. At a little over 100 pages, it is well worth the read.
