An incredible and visionary work on the basis of liberty. Mill delivers the strongest argument for the foundations of institutional design I have found across all the political philosophy I have read.

Though this book is known for its well structured defense of free speech, it is far more than that. Mill presents his vision of the flourishing of individualism as the ultimate goal of civilizational progress, creating an aesthetically beautiful image of the future of humanity.

The common criticism of Mill is that he is a utilitarian. To me, this is a misread - Mill uses the word utility but clarifies that what he means by it something quite different to that of Bentham. He is also an incredible writer and routinely includes fruitful asides with out of distribution wisdom from a variety of seemingly unrelated areas that he has thought about. I do agree though that his definition of liberty as harm avoidance without carefully specified constraints has left room for abuse of his ideas.
