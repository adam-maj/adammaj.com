Locke's justification for overthrowing the English monarchy with the Glorious Revolution, and the foundations of American government. A cohesive view on the basis for government, at first glance appearing to be built with religion as a foundation, but really maintains its grounding even in a secular context.

Locke starts from the fact that humans are equal under nature in their ability to exercise their freedoms, aside from their ability to do harm to others. He builds from here to establish the basis of private property and the grounds for government entrusted by the people with legislative power. Importantly, the government is only legitimate insofar as it represents the public good and has the consent of the majority, and when this condition ceases, revolution is imminent and justified.

Short worthwhile read, and foundational context to build upon in the design of institutional frameworks.
