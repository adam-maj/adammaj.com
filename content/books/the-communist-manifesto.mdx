Given the popularity of Communism, I was at least expecting a very well reasoned and convincing thesis grounded in good intentions, with subtle inaccuracies that would be hard to catch on a first read. Turned out to be much worse than I expected.

Aside from a few legitimate criticism of capitalism which it rests on, the manifesto comes off as a poorly reasoned populist propaganda with the direct intention of seeding chaos. It suspiciously advocates for the centralization of banking and the media under the state, and for the collective ownership of women (which is upstream of societal collapse). Worthwhile reading for everyone since it is such an important cultural phenomenon.
