Useful commentary on the effective mechanisms of repair for organizations. Exit is the primary instrument of change in free market competition, while voice is the tool of politics. Loyalty influences a group members pre-disposition to express dissatisfaction through exit or voice. Important ideas for institutional design, but would have been better off as a short essay.
