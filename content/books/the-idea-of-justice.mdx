A modern moral philosophy base for designing institutions built from a response to Rawls with more focus on pluralism and consequentialism. Better than Rawls in that it replaces many of his maive or narrowly scoped claims with more nuanced and accurate alternatives.

Unfortunately through this intellectual rigor, Sen leaves us with a framework that tries to balance so many perspectives that it becomes entirely unactionable as a basis for an insitutional framework. His main contribution is adding nuance to simplistic ideas about justice and liberty, and highlighting human capabilities as am important end to optimize for in contrast to equality of utility, liberty, or primary goods.

Often considered one of humanities frontiers of political philosophy, but still no resolution to Thomas Nagel's dilemma of equality vs. partiality, which is the ultimate question of modern economic systems, and what I am in search of an answer for.
