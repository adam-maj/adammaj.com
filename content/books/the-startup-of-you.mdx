## My Notes

In the 21st century, careers change unpredictably, technology changes things, and entire industries can emerge and disappear. In order to succeed in this environment, you have to be able to adapt.

Successful startups and people are flexibly persistent - they're true to their values and vision, but remain flexible enough to adapt.
